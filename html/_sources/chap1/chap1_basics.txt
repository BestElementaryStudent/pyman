Installing Python on your computer
==================================

If you haven't already installed Python on your computer, see :ref:`Appendix:Installation`, which includes instructions for installing Python on Macs running under MacOSX and on PCs running under either Windows XP or Windows 7.

Once you have installed Python, find the EPD icon and launch the application.  Wait for a window to appear, like the one shown below.  This is the window you will generally use to work with Python.

The EPD Python window
=====================

The first time you launch the EPD application, the EPD Python window should come up with three panes, as shown in :ref:`Figure 2.1 <fig-EPDcodeEditorWindow>` :ref:`fig-EPDcodeEditorWindow`: the code editor, the interactive Python pane, and the file browser pane.
